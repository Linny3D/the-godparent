## About

This project is a reimplementation of the original [the-godmother](https://github.com/chaosmentors/the-godmother)
project. It's goal is to provide a platform for first time attendees of the chaos events,
such as the congress, to register and find mentors that will share their
knowledge with them.

To make this happen, the godparent provides functions for mentees and mentors to
register, as well as administrative facilities for the orga-teams to match people
and contact them, when the event has begun.

The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/chaosmentors/the-godparent/wiki/Documentation)
